<p>Lukas and Aneta continued to hike, and soon they came across a stream that had swollen due to the rain. The water was rushing by quickly, and they knew they couldn&rsquo;t cross it safely.</p>
<p>Aneta was starting to panic, but Lukas remained calm and positive. He suggested they follow the stream downstream, hoping it would lead to a place where they could safely cross.</p>
<p>After hiking for a while, they found a spot where the stream had narrowed, and they were able to cross safely. Aneta couldn&rsquo;t believe they had made it across, but Lukas just grinned and said, &ldquo;I told you we could do it!&rdquo;</p>
