<p>They set up their tent and made a fire. They talked and laughed as they ate their dinner, feeling grateful for the experience they were having together.</p>
<p>As they went to bed that night, Aneta couldn&rsquo;t help but admit to Lukas, &ldquo;I know I can be negative sometimes, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m on this trip with you.&rdquo;</p>
