Lukas was optimistic and excited about the adventure, while Aneta was negative but always managed to find humor in the situation.</p>
<p>On their first day of hiking, the weather was beautiful and everything seemed to be going well. They even stumbled upon a patch of wild raspberries, which they happily snacked on.</p>
<p>But as they continued on their journey, the weather began to change. Clouds started to gather and the wind picked up. Aneta grumbled about the impending storm, but Lukas remained positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Aneta, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just a passing shower,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just a passing shower. Soon, the sky opened up and rain poured down on them. They hastily put on their rain gear, but it was no match for the downpour.</p>
<p>As they trudged through the rain, Aneta complained about the wet and miserable conditions. Lukas, on the other hand, remained upbeat and optimistic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that hiking in the rain is good for the soul,&rdquo; he said, trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>Aneta rolled her eyes but couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at Lukas&rsquo;s ridiculous statement.</p>
<p>Question: What happens next?</p>
<p>&ndash; <a href="/backpacking/1/">Option 1: They come across a stream that has swollen due to the rain.</a>
&ndash; <a href="/backpacking/2/">Option 2: The rain clears up, and they find a beautiful spot to camp for the night.</a>
&ndash; <a href="/backpacking/3/">Option 3: They realize they&rsquo;re lost and need to find their way back to the trail.</a></p>
