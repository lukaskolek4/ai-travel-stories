*They continue hiking and face another challenge.*

As they continue hiking, they come across a steep uphill section that is difficult to climb. Aneta grumbles about the challenge, but Lukas encourages her and they manage to make it to the top. As they reach the summit, they are greeted by a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains. They take a moment to catch their breath and appreciate the beauty around them. However, as they start to make their way down the other side of the hill, they realize that the path is very steep and slippery, making it difficult to descend safely.
