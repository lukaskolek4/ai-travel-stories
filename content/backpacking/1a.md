*They find a place to camp for the night.*

They set up camp for the night near the stream, enjoying the sound of the rushing water. However, during the night, the stream rises even higher due to continued rainfall, and they wake up to find their campsite partially flooded. Lukas suggests they move to higher ground, but Aneta worries about finding a safe place to set up camp. They eventually find a spot, but it takes some time to get settled. Despite the difficulties, they manage to have a cozy night's sleep in their tent, with the sound of raindrops lulling them to sleep.
