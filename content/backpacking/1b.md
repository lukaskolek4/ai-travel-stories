*They continue hiking and face another challenge.*

As they continue hiking, they come across a fallen tree that has blocked the trail. They have to climb over it, which is difficult due to the wet and slippery conditions. Aneta is hesitant, but Lukas is determined to get past the obstacle. With his encouragement, they manage to climb over the tree and continue on their journey. As they hike, they come across a group of friendly hikers who are able to give them some helpful tips for the rest of their journey.
