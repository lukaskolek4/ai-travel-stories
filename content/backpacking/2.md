*The rain clears up, and they find a beautiful spot to camp for the night.*

As they continued hiking, the rain slowly cleared up. The sun came out, and they were surrounded by beautiful scenery.

Aneta couldn't help but smile at the sight, and Lukas was beaming with joy. They found a perfect spot to camp for the night, with a stunning view of the mountains.

They set up their tent and made a fire. They talked and laughed as they ate their dinner, feeling grateful for the experience they were having together.

As they went to bed that night, Aneta couldn't help but admit to Lukas, "I know I can be negative sometimes, but I'm glad I'm on this trip with you."
