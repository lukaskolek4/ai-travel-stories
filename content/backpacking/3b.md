*They continue to be lost and face more challenges.*

As they continue to be lost, they realize they're running out of food and water. They have to ration what they have left and try to find a way out before they run out completely. They also face another storm, which makes their situation even more difficult. Aneta becomes more negative and starts to feel like they'll never find their way back to the trail. However, Lukas remains optimistic and tries to keep her spirits up. They stumble upon a small shelter that has been left by a previous hiker, and they are able to take shelter from the storm. They spend the night there, feeling grateful for the unexpected refuge. The next day, they decide to try to find their way back to the trail again, and after a few more hours of wandering, they finally come across a signpost that leads them back to the trail. They let out a sigh of relief and continue on their journey, feeling more determined and stronger after the challenges they've faced. They also make a mental note to pack extra food and water for their next trip, just in case they get lost again.
