*They come across a stream that has swollen due to the rain.*

Lukas and Aneta continued to hike, and soon they came across a stream that had swollen due to the rain. The water was rushing by quickly, and they knew they couldn't cross it safely.

Aneta was starting to panic, but Lukas remained calm and positive. He suggested they follow the stream downstream, hoping it would lead to a place where they could safely cross.

After hiking for a while, they found a spot where the stream had narrowed, and they were able to cross safely. Aneta couldn't believe they had made it across, but Lukas just grinned and said, "I told you we could do it!"
